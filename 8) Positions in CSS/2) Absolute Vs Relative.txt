1) Relative Positioning:

 *) Relative positioning is the default positioning scheme for HTML elements.

 *) When an element is set to "position: relative," it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. 
    In other words, the element retains its space in the layout, and the positioning is adjusted relative to that initial position.
 
 *) When you use properties like "top," "right," "bottom," and "left" with relative positioning, 
    the element is moved from its normal position by the specified amount. However, the space it originally occupied is preserved, and other elements are not affected by the movement.
 
 *) Elements with relative positioning can overlap other elements, but they still occupy space in the document flow.

2) Absolute Positioning:

 *) Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow, 
    and its position is defined relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element with a positioning property set to anything other than "static").

 *) Elements with absolute positioning do not occupy space in the layout, and other elements can overlap them. 
    This makes them suitable for creating overlays, pop-up windows, or other elements that need to be positioned precisely on the page.
 
 *) To use absolute positioning effectively, you often need to set the "top," "right," "bottom," or "left" properties,
    to specify the exact position of the element relative to its containing element with relative or absolute positioning.
